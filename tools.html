			<p class="p-1 para"><h2>Want to know how can you earn by doing affiliate marketing?</h2></p>
			
			<p class="p-1 para">Helping people is the key to become a <b>successful affiliate marketer</b>.</p>
			
			<p class="p-1 para">Now the question comes how would you <b>help</b> people. You can help people by providing them with the <b>solution</b> to their <b>burning problem</b> that they cannot solve by their own.</p> 
			
			<p class="p-1 para">But nobody is going to come to you and ask for your help right. Because they don't know you, they do not trust you yet.</p>
			
			<p class="p-1 para">So, you have to put across yourself to everyone. You have to present yourself, so that people begin to know you, trust you. How would you do that?</p>
			
			<p class="p-1 para">You can reach out to people with your solution by <b>social media</b>, <b>blog posts</b>, <b>videos</b>, <b>print media</b>, <b>television ads</b>, <b>website</b> etc.</p>
			
			<p class="p-1 para">Create <b>valuable contents.</b> Content means the subject matter, every detail of a certain thing.</p>
			
			<p class="p-1 para">For instance, people might want to know how to create a WordPress blog. So create a content around it, share you experience in your blog how did you created your WordPress blog, step by step. Like you purchased a managed WordPress hosting for you from a hosting provider. Then you set up WordPress in that hosting. Then you created a site admin and password. </p>
			
			<p class="p-1 para">Every little detail like, after logging in with your credentials, you went to "Appearence > Themes" and installed your theme. How did you install Yoast SEO in your WordPress setup. How did you created your first blog post. How did you set up focused keyword in Yoast SEO. Every details.</p>
			
			<p class="p-1 para">So that when a user read your step by step tutorial he can setup his own wordpress website entirely and create his first blog post. </p>
			
			<p class="p-1 para">You see you have provided this amount of value in your post your visitors will be benefited from you. They begin to trust you. They will become your lifetime audience. </p>
			
			<h2 class="p-1">How can I create a blog?</h2>
			
			<p class="p-1 para">The very popular, easy way to create your presence on the internet is by creating a <b>blog</b> or <b>website</b>. Creating a blog is very easy as walking in the park.</p>
			
			<p class="p-1 para">Either you can create a blog or website using <b>WordPress</b> or plain <b>HTML</b>. I recommend WordPress to most of my readers, as building a website or blog in WordPress will take only 2 - 3 hours.</p>
			
			<p class="p-1 para">You can also create your blog on <b>WordPress</b> at <b>wordpress.com</b> for <b>free</b>. The problem with the free wordpress.com blog is that you cannot customize the URL as you desire.</p>
			
			<p class="p-1 para">Your blog will always come with a domain like <b>yourblogname.wordpress.com</b> as you are directly using their service. WordPress promotes itself like that. It would not help you to grow your brand.</p>

			<p class="p-1 para">But <b>affiliate marketing</b> is a serious business. It's not a money-making scheme. You have to take it like any other <b>internet-based business</b> like <b>Amazon, eBay</b>.</p>

			<p class="p-1 para">To build your brand on the internet you need your personalized domain. Like <b>yourname.com</b> or <b>yourbusinessname.com</b> or <b>yourbrandname.com</b>.</p>

			<p class="p-1 para">And you can host your WordPress blog at a hosting solution that map with your domain name. Get your <a href="https://namecheap.pxf.io/c/2733920/1016192/5618" target="_blank"><b>super-fast WordPress hosting and domain</b> by clicking here</a>.</p>
			
			<p class="p-1 para">That's all for now. See you in my blog for more marketing and technical solutions.</p>
